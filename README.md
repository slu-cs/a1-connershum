Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - I can't find how to email the BoE.
    - The registration deadline for the April 28 election isn't in the calendar.
    - The absentee application deadline for the November 3 election isn't in the calendar.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The Absentee Voting page is outside the main navigation structure, which makes it harder to find.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The headers and buttons form kind of a surprising color combo.
