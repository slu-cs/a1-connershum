Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - I can't find how to email the BoE.
    - I have to dig a bit to find the Absentee Voting page.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The How to Vote and Absentee Voting pages are a little lengthy and could use a bit more internal structure.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The headers and buttons form kind of a surprising color combo.
